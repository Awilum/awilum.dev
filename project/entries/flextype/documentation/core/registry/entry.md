A registry is a container for storing objects and values in the Flextype application space. By storing the value in a registry, the same object is always available throughout Flextype application. This mechanism is an alternative to using global storage. Flextype Registry is build on top of [Glowy Registry Package]((getBaseUrl)/glowyphp/registry).
