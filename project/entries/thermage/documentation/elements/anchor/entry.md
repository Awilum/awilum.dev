The Anchor element, with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to the web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address. If your terminal belongs to the [list of terminal emulators that support links](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda). Otherwise, youâ€™ll see Link as regular text and the URL will be lost.
